COST-PLANIFICATOR-APP

This budget tracking application is made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. The application uses the React-Swipeable-List and React-Circular-Progressbar libraries.

The application has an input to load the available money or budget and a submit button. When submitted, a component is rendered that shows the available balance and the spent balance as a percentage in a progress circle. In addition, there is a button that, when clicked, opens a modal in which a new expenditure and its details can be added. When the form is completed and the expenditure is added, a component is rendered with the details of the expenditure entered. This component with the expenditure entered can be edited by swiping it to the right or deleted by swiping it to the left.

The application is designed to help people keep track of their expenses and maintain control of their budget.
